<h1>Deckahedron World</h1>
<h2>Like Board Games? Remember Dungeons &amp; Dragons? Want To Try Improv?</h2>

<h3>Deckahedron World Is a Role-Playing Game...</h3>
...about gathering at a table with your friends and creating an <i>improvisational</i> story, where the
GM generally has authority over the world and NPCs, and the players have authority over what their
characters do. Though, there are clear prompts for the players to create parts of the world as well.
The main goal for the players is to <b>build their characters up to be forces to be reckoned with</b>.
The main goal for the GM is to earn points by hitting <b>the milestones of The Hero's Journey</b>.
</p>
<p>
Deckahedron World is a game about a party of fate-tempting adventurers becoming a force to be reckoned
with in the dangerous kingdoms of a swords-and-magic fantasy realm. There are castle infiltrations,
earthshaking discoveries, monster battles, sinful indulgences, secret loyalties, promises,
paybacks, and deaths.
</p>

Unlike other swords &amp; sorcery role-playing games, it...
<ul>
    <li>...reduces player components down to just a deck of cards and some tokens</li>
    <li>...uses blanks as a design element to let players know where they have full control</li>
    <li>...specifically instructs the GM to ask questions of players to encourage improvisation</li>
    <li>...softens the learning curve by splitting the rules across 3 sessions</li>
</ul>
