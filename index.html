          <li>A Thousand Faces of Adventure takes the
            <strong>deck-building</strong> and <strong>set-collection</strong>
            mechanisms of modern board games like Gloomhaven and marries them
            with the innovation blossoming in indie role-playing games like
            Fate and Dungeon World.
          </li>
          <li>Are you a fan of RPGs and your friends are all board gamers?
            Looking for the right RPG to introduce them to the world of
            play-to-find-out-what-happens? A Thousand Faces of Adventure was
            designed for you.
          </li>
          <li>When new players sit down to play, there's no hundred-page
            tome they're expected to navigate, just familiar-looking board
            game components. The GM can walk the players through a well-tested
            ten-step process that creates the characters and their world
            <strong>in 45 minutes</strong>.
          </li>
          <li>Furthermore, <b>all the math is baked-in</b>. The probability
            curves are carefully designed and distributed into a 20-card deck,
            so players only need to flip a card and see the result on the face.

        <p>A Thousand Faces of Adventure is a game about a party of
          fate-tempting adventurers becoming champions of their own Hero's
          Journey, in the dangerous kingdoms of a swords-and-magic fantasy
          realm.
          There are castle infiltrations, earthshaking discoveries,
          monster battles, sinful indulgences, secret loyalties, promises,
          paybacks, and deaths.</p>
        <p><b>Unlike other swords &amp; sorcery role-playing games, it...</b></p>
        <p>...challenges players to master its system <i>not</i> by reading
          hundreds of pages, but by exploring its board game dynamics</p>
        <p>...softens the learning curve by splitting the rules across 3
          sessions</p>
        <p>...uses blanks as a design element to let players know where they
          have full control</p>
        <p>...encourages improvisation by specifically instructing the GM to
          ask questions of players</p>
        <p>...reduces player components down to just a deck of cards and
          some tokens</p>

        <ul class="grid">
          <li>Like a board game, a role-playing game is played by sitting around a
            table with your friends. But, as a role-playing game, A Thousand Faces
            of Adventure is a little different.
          </li>
          <li>It's asymmetrical. One friend plays the "GM" role and is playing
            with different rules from the others</li>
          <li>The action takes place in a shared, imagined world. It's like
            collaborative group storytelling</li>
          <li>Like a "legacy" board game, the state of the game changes by
            playing it. Players change their characters from one session to the
            next, and the entire fantasy world changes too</li>
          <li>The story and challenges are improvised! A Thousand Faces of
            Adventure lays out a series of milestones and prompts, but you need to
            play to find out the details of what happens</li>
