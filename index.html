            <p> ...about gathering at a table with your friends and creating
            an improvisational story, where one of you plays the GM, who
            has narrative authority over the world and events, and the rest
            of you play characters being challenged by and exploring this
            world, even creating parts of it!

          <li>A Thousand Faces of Adventure takes the
          <strong>deck-building</strong> and <strong>set-collection</strong>
          mechanisms of modern board games like Gloomhaven and marries them
          with the innovation blossoming in indie role-playing games like
          FATE and Dungeon World.
          </li>
          <li>Are you a fan of RPGs and your friends are all board gamers?
          Looking for the right RPG to introduce them to the world of
          play-to-find-out-what-happens? A Thousand Faces of Adventure was
          designed for you.

          <li>When new players sit down to play, there's no hundred-page
          tome they're expected to navigate, just familiar-looking board
          game components. The GM can walk the players through a well-tested
          ten-step process that creates the characters and their world
          <strong>in 45 minutes</strong>.

        <p>A Thousand Faces of Adventure is a game about a party of
        fate-tempting adventurers becoming champions of their own Hero's
        Journey, in the dangerous kingdoms of a swords-and-magic fantasy
        realm.
        There are castle infiltrations, earthshaking discoveries,
        monster battles, sinful indulgences, secret loyalties, promises,
        paybacks, and deaths.</p>
        <p><b>Unlike other swords &amp; sorcery role-playing games, it...</b></p>
        <p>...challenges players to master its system <i>not</i> by reading
        hundreds of pages, but by exploring its board game dynamics</p>
        <p>...softens the learning curve by splitting the rules across 3
        sessions</p>
        <p>...uses blanks as a design element to let players know where they
        have full control</p>
        <p>...encourages improvisation by specifically instructing the GM to
        ask questions of players</p>
        <p>...reduces player components down to just a deck of cards and
        some tokens</p>

        <ul class="grid">
          <li>Like a board game, a role-playing game is played by sitting around a
          table with your friends. But, as a role-playing game, A Thousand Faces
          of Adventure is a little different.
          </li>
          <li>It's asymmetrical. One friend plays the "GM" role and is playing
          with different rules from the others</li>
          <li>The action takes place in a shared, imagined world. It's like
          collaborative group storytelling</li>
          <li>Like a "legacy" board game, the state of the game changes by
          playing it. Players change their characters from one session to the
          next, and the entire fantasy world changes too</li>
          <li>The story and challenges are improvised! A Thousand Faces of
          Adventure lays out a series of milestones and prompts, but you need to
          play to find out the details of what happens</li>
