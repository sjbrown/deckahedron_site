# A Thousand Faces of Adventure Art Spec


## Background

A Thousand Faces of Adventure is a role-playing game
(like Dungeons & Dragons) where players' experience a "Hero's Journey" story
structure, but the details of this story, including the characters, are
created by the players' imaginations. Just like a Hollywood blockbuster movie,
we know the structure is pre-determined at the beginning: heros will start
in a familiar world, be provoked by a strong need to cross a threshold,
search through an Unknown World until they find the thing they need and pay
its price, then return back to their home, changed. Die Hard is very
different from Lord of the Rings, and Star Wars is different from Pixar's
Inside Out, but they all share the common Hero's Journey structure.

## Cover concept

To communicate that this game provides a consistent story structure, but
the details are dependent on the players' imaginations, I am commissioning
multiple artists to create their own version of a cover for the game. The
covers will all have things in common, but will exhibit a wide variety of
styles and tones. That way, players will see how it is possible to create
a wide variety of characters and story while working inside rigid
structural constraints.

## Composition requirements

(See attached image)

The composition will be on a rectangular canvas with the "A Thousand Faces
of Adventure" wordmark centered and positioned in the top third of the
canvas.

From the point of the triangle, there is a spiral of focus, moving from
zones 1, 2, 3, 4. See attached image.

### The Prize

At the point of the triangle is "the prize". This is a magical
boon that was found in the Unknown World which enables the heros to make
the needed changes in their home. It is the thing that "rekindles The
Hearth". This prize is being held aloft by the "Integrated Hero".

Examples:

 * The One Ring in Lord of the Rings
 * The machine gun in Die Hard
 * The light saber in Star Wars

### Zone 1 - The Integrated Hero

The central character is the Integrated Hero, who holds aloft the prize.
This character has round, square, and triangular shapes, either in body
shape, face shape, or in clothing or decoration.

This character is injured.


### Zone 2 - The Helper Hero

The character on the right is the Helper Hero, who supports the Integrated
Hero.

This character has round shapes, either in body shape, face shape, or
in clothing or decoration.

This character embodies love, compassion, and concern.


### Zone 3 - The Defender Hero

The character on the center/left is the Defender Hero, who defends the
other two heros.

This character has square shapes, either in body shape, face shape, or
in clothing or decoration.

This character embodies strength, rigidity, and endurance.


### Zone 4 - The Adversaries

In zone 4 we see the adversaries. These represent the opposition, danger,
or violence faced by the heroes.

These adversaries have triangle shapes, either in body shape, face shape, or
in clothing or decoration.

Optionally this zone also contains "the shadow self" which is a representation
of what the integrated hero would be if they gave in to cowardice. Often
death imagery is used for the shadow, or things that are ancient, unmoving and
unchanging.


## Diversity

Representing a diverse audience is important to me. Your artistic instincts
are most important, but if you are inclined, please see if you can balance
the genders of the characters and represent characters of backgrounds that
are not typically represented.

## Mood board

More important than the mood board is your own particular style. You were
selected because there is something about your work that makes you distinct,
and I want that personality to shine through in the finished product.
