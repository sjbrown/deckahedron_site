 * No numbers > 10.  Even 10 is too high.  Stick to 4 or lower.
 * Visibility! Get the information on the table, easy to scan.
   * helps the GM scale the challenges
   * helps the GM see what opportunities to open up for the players
     * Clearly if a player chose a skill, they want an opportunity to use it
 * Arithmetic sucks
   * "Flip 3, take the best" is easier than "roll 2d6, add your Strength bonus"
 * One action (a "flip") can result in many values
   (so the cards can be "multi-dimensional")
 * [Thematic flips](mod_thematic_flips.md)
 * Cheap and portable
 * Cards rather than dice.  Cards open up richer game play mechanics
   * hiding values
   * player choice about when to shuffle can be interesting
   * look at top *n* cards, and put them back in any order
   * drafting
   * backs of cards can be marked
   * collect special cards
   * deckbuilding mechanic
   * cards can be written on
   * Spot It / Dobble mechanic
